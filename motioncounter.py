## Detect movement in images or frames of video
## Compares each new frame with the average of the previous frames
## Checks if the brightness of individual pixels has changed significantly,
## and such changed pixels form a roughly insect-sized area
## Returns the number of insect-sized areas that have moved, and (optionally) their bounding boxes.
## Called by 'analyse.py'
